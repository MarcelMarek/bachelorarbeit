\begin{itemize}
    \item Active learning (AL) (Settles 2009), in which the system remains in control of the
learning process and treats humans as oracles to annotate unlabeled data.
    \item Interactive machine learning (IML) (Amershi et al. 2014), in which there is a closer
interaction between users and learning systems, with people interactively supplying
information in a more focused, frequent, and incremental way compared to traditional
machine learning.
    \item Machine teaching (MT) (Simard et al. 2017; Ramos et al. 2020), where human domain
experts have control over the learning process by delimiting the knowledge that they
intend to transfer to the machine learning model.
